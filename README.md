This [docker compose](./docker-compose.yml) file below will guide you on how to run all the components listed above.

### Create database credential for web app
```sh
cp ./webapp/cred.json.example ./webapp/cred.json
# Edit ./webapp/cred.json base on your environment
```

**Run all storm cluster**

```cmd
docker compose up -d
```

**Then apply iot-data-smarthome topo**

```cmd
docker exec -it nimbus bash

storm jar /target/Storm-IOTdata-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.storm.iotdata.MainTopo
```

**Run MQTT components**

After create storm cluster topology which have MQTT broker container, we need run MQTT publisher to send data to MQTT broker and storm will receive data. To run MQTT publisher follow [this guide](./mqtt/mqtt-publisher/README.md).
